LeetCode solutions

This is a repository that contains my solutions to Leetcode problems. Leetcode is a popular platform for practicing algorithm and data structure problems, and I've been using it to improve my problem-solving skills.

In this repository, you'll find my solutions to various Leetcode problems, organized by their respective difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, and Hard). Each problem's solution is presented in a separate file, and includes a brief explanation of the problem statement, the approach used to solve it, and the code implementation.

I've implemented the solutions in Python, but I plan to add solutions in other languages as well. I've also included test cases to verify the correctness of each solution.

Feel free to use these solutions as a reference for your own Leetcode practice. However, please keep in mind that Leetcode prohibits users from sharing exact solutions to their premium problems. Therefore, I've only included solutions to problems that are available in the free version of Leetcode.

If you have any feedback, suggestions, or improvements to my solutions, feel free to create an issue or pull request. I'm always open to learning and improving my problem-solving skills.

Happy coding!
